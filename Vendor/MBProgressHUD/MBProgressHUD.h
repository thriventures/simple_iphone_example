/**
 * Displays a simple HUD window containing a UIActivityIndicatorView and two optional labels for short messages.
 *
 * This is a simple drop-in class for displaying a progress HUD view similar to Apples private UIProgressHUD class. 
 * The MBProgressHUD window spans over the entire space given to it by the initWithFrame constructor and catches all user 
 * input on this region, thereby preventing the user operations on components below the view. 
 * The HUD itself is drawn centered as a rounded semi-transparent view witch resizes depending on the user specified content. 
 * This view supports three modes of operation:
 * - The default mode displays just a UIActivityIndicatorView. 
 * - If the labelText property is set and non-empty then a label containing the provided content is placed below the UIActivityIndicatorView. 
 * - If also the detailsLabelText property is set then another label is placed below the firs label.
